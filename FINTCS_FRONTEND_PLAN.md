- `POST /api/auth/register` - New user registration (admin only)

### User Management Endpoints:
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/{id}/role` - Update user role (admin only)

### Member Management Endpoints:
- `GET /api/member` - Get all members
- `GET /api/member/{id}` - Get member by ID
- `POST /api/member` - Create new member
- `PUT /api/member/{id}` - Update member
- `POST /api/member/{id}/approve-changes` - Approve member changes
- `GET /api/member/pending-changes` - Get pending member changes

### Society Management Endpoints:
- `GET /api/society` - Get society information

- Secure logout with token invalidation

### Authorization:
- Role-based route protection
- Component-level permission checking
- API call authorization headers

### Data Validation:
- Client-side form validation
- Server response error handling
- Input sanitization

## Current Status
